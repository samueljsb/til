title: How to add favicons to a website

I have a few small static sites I made for things like showing bus arrival times
and keeping score during card games. I have links to those on my phone
home screen and in bookmarks and they look a bit rubbish without proper icons.

"Proper" websites have favicons: the little icon that appears in the browser tab
and next to bookmarks. It's pretty easy to add those to websites, but generating
the images in all the right sizes and formats can be a bit of a chore.

I just started adding hand-drawn favicons to my sites by making the images in my
iPad, exporting them as PNGs, and generating the icon files with
<https://www.favicon-generator.org/>. It handily generates all of the formats
for every platform and gives me the HTML I need to add to my page's header to
get the icons appearing correctly. And now they do!

I also made sure to run all of the files through
[`optipng`](https://optipng.sourceforge.net/) before uploading them, just to make
sure they were taking up as little space as possible.
